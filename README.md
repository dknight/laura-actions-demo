This demonstration showcases the process of testing a piece of code across six
different versions of the Lua programming language. The goal is to ensure
compatibility, identify potential issues, and observe any differences in
behavior between versions. By running these tests, we can assess the code’s
performance, stability, and necessary adjustments for seamless functionality
across all Lua versions.

- Lua 5.1
- Lua 5.2
- Lua 5.3
- Lua 5.4
- LuaJIT 2.1
- LuaJIT-OpenResty
